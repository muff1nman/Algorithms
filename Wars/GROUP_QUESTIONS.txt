3. We implemented a greedy algorithm that focused on keeping vertices that had
shared an edge with a high weight together.  From there we attempted to
minimize cost increases as lower priority edges were added

5. 25% 4 ways
6. Matt did a lot of theory and first introducted the algorithm. Andrew and
Aakash did a lot of the coding alongside Matt & Josh. Josh really helped nail
out the problems by making pythong scripts to generate tests.

7. Finding a non-exhaustive solution that still performed well for our tests.

8. Make it dynamic, rather than greedy. Solve the problem in
polynomial time.

9. No, our team worked very well in this setup inspite of having four
group members.
